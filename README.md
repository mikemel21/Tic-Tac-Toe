# Overview
This is a very simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made in Pygame. I used this project to get used to Python after a little break from it.
I also used it to set up and practice within Neovim. As of right now, it is EXTREMELY primitive, bare bones, and unoptimized.
Over time I hope to optimize it and add more features to explore Pygame a little more.
